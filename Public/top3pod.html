                The goal of collaboration is to create a sum greater 
                than the whole of its parts: brands collaborate out of a 
                utilitarian urge to pool their collective audience reach. 
                Luxury brands want to downmarket their brand (without diluting it) 
                and so collaborate with sportswear companies; streetwear brands want the 
                approval of fashion even as they position themselves outside its 
                norms and so they collaborate with high end designers. This is extremely 
                effective. <a href="https://mschfx.com/manifesto/">Learn More...</a>

        <h2>Birkenstocks</h2>

            <p class="podtext">
                Birkinstocks are made from genuine Birkin bags, 
                which are first disassembled, then flattened. We 
                then cut our pattern from this Birkin leather, 
                and assemble it together with a Birkenstock cork 
                footbed and rubber sole. All Birkinstocks are 
                crafted by hand in USA. Because our process starts 
                with an individual Birkin bag, each pair of 
                Birkinstocks is a singular bespoke object. There is 
                no stock model. <a href="https://birkinstock.shoes/">Learn More...</a>
